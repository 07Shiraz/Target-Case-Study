## Problem Statement:

Assuming you are a data analyst/ scientist at Target, you have been assigned the task of analyzing the given dataset to extract valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations.

## Recommdations

1.	A suggestion could be to advise Target to offer increased discounts and perks to customers who use debit cards since this payment method is currently the least utilized.
2.	Enhancements are needed in inventory management and logistics for specific states mentioned earlier. These improvements aim to reduce delivery times and ensure that estimated delivery schedules better match the actual delivery times, preventing customers from receiving orders unexpectedly.
3.	Improved logistics will also decrease the average freight costs. 
4.	To enhance the affordability of larger purchases, Target should consider offering zero-cost EMI options and discounts for transactions with 12 or more installments, as products with higher installment counts tend to have fewer orders due to their typically higher price tags.
5.	Since monthly sales are consistently on the rise, it is advisable for Target to concentrate on expanding its presence in the Brazilian market to avoid any potential shortages or delays.
6.	The state of Sao Paulo (SP) holds significant importance for Target, as it constitutes the primary source of most orders. Target should prioritize efforts to decrease delivery times within this region.
